  body: '<p>There’s a simple secret to building a faster website — <em>just ship less</em>.</p><p
    class="astro-sYrAQHs5">Unfortunately, modern web development has been trending
    in the opposite direction—towards <em>more.</em> More JavaScript, more features,
    more moving parts, and ultimately more complexity needed to keep it all running
    smoothly.</p><p class="astro-sYrAQHs5">Today I’m excited to publicly share Astro:
    a new kind of static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with
    a modern developer experience. To design Astro, we borrowed the best parts of
    our favorite tools and then added a few innovations of our own, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bring
    Your Own Framework (BYOF):</strong> Build your site using React, Svelte, Vue,
    Preact, web components, or just plain ol’ HTML + JavaScript.</p></li><li><p><strong>100%
    Static HTML, No JS:</strong> Astro renders your entire page to static HTML, removing
    all JavaScript from your final build by default.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-Demand
    Components:</strong> Need some JS? Astro can automatically hydrate interactive
    components when they become visible on the page. If the user never sees it, they
    never load it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fully-Featured:</strong> Astro supports
    TypeScript, Scoped CSS, CSS Modules, Sass, Tailwind, Markdown, MDX, and any of
    your favorite npm packages.</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO Enabled:</strong> Automatic
    sitemaps, RSS feeds, pagination and collections take the pain out of SEO and syndication.</p></li></ul><p
    class="astro-sYrAQHs5">This post marks the first public beta release of Astro.
    <strong>Missing features and bugs are still to be expected at this early stage.</strong>
    There are still some months to go before an official 1.0 release, but there are
    already several fast sites built with Astro in production today. We would love
    your early feedback as we move towards a v1.0 release later this year.</p>'
